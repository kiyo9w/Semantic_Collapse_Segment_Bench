# AI Writing Guidelines for Research Papers

**Goal:** Write strictly in a human, academic researcher voice. Avoid all "AI-generated" patterns, clichés, and formatting quirks.

## 1. Vocabulary & Phrasing (The "Banned List")
Never use the following words or phrases. They are instant markers of AI text.

| **Banned Word** | **Replace With** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Necessitate** | Need, Require |
| **Disseminate** | Share, Distribute |
| **Leverage** / **Utilize** | Use, Apply |
| **Facilitate** | Help, Enable |
| **Underscore** | Highlight, Show |
| **Crucial / Pivotal / Paramount** | Important, Key, Critical |
| **Delve / Dive into** | Examine, Explore, Investigate |
| **Realm / Landscape** | Field, Area, Context |
| **Foster** | Support, Encourage |
| **Merely** | Only, Just |
| **Notably** / **Significantly** | (Remove distinct marker, just state the fact) |
| **Tapestry / Mosaic / Interwoven** | Complex, Connected |
| **Nuance / Symphony** | Detail, Balance |
| **Ultimatemly / In the end** | (Delete. Do not moralize or summarize "lessons") |

## 2. Formatting & Punctuation
*   **NO Hyphens in Compound Nouns:**
    *   ❌ `decision-making`, `real-time`, `web-based`, `water-energy-food`, `threshold-based`
    *   ✅ `making decisions` (or `decision making`), `real time`, `web based`, `water energy food`, `based on thresholds`
    * **Strategic Hyphenation:** >     * Do not use hyphens to create "marketing-style" buzzwords. 
    * However, use standard academic hyphens for compound modifiers before a noun for clarity (e.g., "real-time data," "large-scale study"). For most of the case, if it can be claried with non enhyphen word with the same length, avoid using enhypen in those cases.
    * Avoid hyphens when the phrase follows the noun (e.g., "the data was collected in real time").
*   **NO Semicolons (;):** Do not use semicolons to connect independent clauses. Use a full stop.
    * **Minimalist Punctuation:** >     * Favor full stops over semicolons for clarity. 
    * Only use a semicolon if it is absolutely necessary to separate complex items in a list that already contains commas.
*   **NO Em-dashes (—):** Do not use em-dashes for parenthetical thoughts. Use commas.
*   **NO Numbered Lists in Paragraphs:** Do not write "First, ... Second, ..." inside a block of text.
*   **Avoid the "And" Connector:** Do not endlessly connect independent clauses with ", and" to create "balanced" sentences. Split them into separate sentences for impact.

## 3. Sentence Structure (The "Burstiness" Rule)
*   **Vary Sentence Length:** Human writing is "bursty". Mix long, complex sentences with short, direct ones. Avoid a hypnotic, steady rhythm where every sentence is 20 words long.
*   **Simpler Words, Complex Structure:**
    *   *Bad (AI):* "The implementation of this framework necessitates the utilization of advanced algorithms to facilitate data processing." (Fancy words, simple structure).
    *   *Good (Human):* "Because the framework processes data using advanced algorithms, we must implement it carefully to avoid errors." (Simple words, complex dependent clause).
*   **Terminology:**
    * Use "**This study**" or "**This paper**" instead of "**This work**" or "**This article**".

## 4. Content & Tone
*   **No Moralizing:** Do not end sections with a "lesson learned" or a "neat summary" of why this is good for humanity. State the facts and move on.
*   **Specificity over Generality:**
    *   *Generic (AI):* "The system handles various environmental factors."
    *   *Specific (Human):* "The system processes pH, salinity, and dissolved oxygen levels."
*   **Show, Don't Summarize:** Do not say "The results were promising." Show the specific numbers (e.g., "The accuracy reached 92%.").
*   **Opening:** Avoid generic openers like "Recent strides have been made...".
*   **Preferred:** "New studies have confirmed..." or "[Author] showed that..."
