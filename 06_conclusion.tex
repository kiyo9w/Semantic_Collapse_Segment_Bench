\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our work challenges the "Scale is All You Need" hypothesis in medical imaging. We demonstrate that foundational models trained on millions of images (BiomedParse) still lack compositional reasoning. \textbf{SemantiBench} provides the community with a rigorous tool to measure this gap, and \textbf{SemantiSeg} offers a blueprint for closing it. We conclude that future SOTA models must be evaluated not just on \textit{what} they segment, but \textit{how well} they understand the user's intent.
