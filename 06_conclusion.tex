\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our results suggest that scale alone is insufficient. Foundation models trained on millions of images (BiomedParse) still lack compositional reasoning. \textbf{SemantiBench} provides the community with a rigorous tool to measure this gap, and \textbf{FreqMedClip} offers a blueprint for closing it.

\paragraph{Limitations.} One limitation of SemantiBench is its reliance on synthetic prompts generated by VLMs, which may introduce alignment bias. While our Critic Loop reduces hallucinations, future work should validate performance on human-annotated clinical datasets.

SemantiBench and FreqMedCLIP provide the community with tools to measure and close this gap.
